[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning is by git tag. Because
installs are symlinks, changes on `main` reach a user's clone on their next
`git pull` — keep `main` releasable.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — initial framework

- **Agent-neutral practices** (`base/practices/`): shell hygiene, git/PR discipline,
  CI diagnose-before-rerun, out-of-scope → tracked issue, repo-scope verification,
  evidence-first debugging, mandatory self-review, logging/secrets.
- **Role model** (`base/roles.md`, `templates/agents.toml`): per-project `primary` /
  `gap_analysis` / `review` / `debug` assignment; swap `primary` with no workflow
  change. Resolution order repo → global default → built-in.
- **Claude agent** (fully wired): six skills — `implement-issue` (role-aware,
  auto-detecting gates, repo-scope + self-review baked in), `create-issue`,
  `resolve-pr-threads`, `new-release`, and the new `cleanup` (sweep all merged
  branches, named explicitly) and `debug` (evidence-first root cause). Two Stop-hook
  gates + statusline.
- **Gate auto-detection** (`scripts/lib/project-gates.sh`): pnpm/npm/yarn/bun, cargo,
  go, python; honors `agents.toml [gates]`; the global gate **defers to any repo that
  ships its own** so nothing double-runs.
- **Codex + Gemini adapters**: install the shared practices into `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
  / `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`; deeper workflow parity tracked in Issues.
- **Install contract**: `install.sh --agent …` (symlink + jq-merged Stop hooks,
  backed up, idempotent), `uninstall.sh`, `bin/agent-init`.
- **Tooling**: `scripts/build.sh` (render practices → root docs), `scripts/selfcheck.sh`
  (local CI mirror), CI (shellcheck · build-drift · frontmatter · gate-detector ·
  install dry-run), contributor guide (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
