# Adding a new agent

The framework currently ships `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini` as agent
tokens (see [roles-and-agents.md](roles-and-agents.md)). Adding another AI
coding agent — this doc uses a hypothetical token `foo` as the running
example — touches a small, well-defined set of places. Deep per-agent
workflow parity (matching Claude's skills feature-for-feature, say) is the
harder, optional part; the steps below are what's required for `foo` to be
installable and assignable to a role at all.

## 1. Add `agents/foo/adapter.sh`

`install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` already know how to drive an adapter for any
token that isn't `claude` — the `codex` and `gemini` branches in both scripts
call `bash "$REPO/agents/$agent/adapter.sh" install|uninstall …` if that file
exists, and print `"adapter not present yet (deferred) — skipping"` if it
doesn't. `codex` and `gemini` each ship a working `adapter.sh` you can copy as a
template; `foo` just needs its own, following the same contract. All the
symlink + backup logic is shared — the adapters **source**
`scripts/lib/common.sh` and call `adb_link` / `adb_unlink_if_ours` /
`adb_info`; they do not re-implement it (design-principle #1, single-source —
see [design-principles.md](design-principles.md)).

The adapter must implement two subcommands, matching how it's invoked:

```bash
# install.sh calls:
bash "$REPO/agents/foo/adapter.sh" install "$REPO" "$BACKUP_DIR"

# uninstall.sh calls:
bash "$REPO/agents/foo/adapter.sh" uninstall "$REPO"
```

`install <repo> <backup_dir>` must, at minimum:

- **Source the shared library:** `. "$repo/scripts/lib/common.sh"` (or, robustly
  from the adapter's own location, `"$(dirname "$0")/../../scripts/lib/common.sh"`,
  as the `codex`/`gemini` adapters do).
- **Symlink the generated root doc** with `adb_link "$repo/agents/foo/FOO.md"
  "$HOME/.foo/FOO.md" "$backup_dir"`. `adb_link` already does the whole
  backup-then-link dance: correct symlink → no-op; wrong symlink → replace;
  real file → move under the backup dir (mirrored absolute path) → link. It is
  idempotent, so running `install.sh --agent foo` twice produces the same end
  state with no duplicate backups.
- If `foo` supports skills or gate scripts analogous to Claude's, `adb_link`
  those too — same helper, same pattern.

`uninstall <repo>` calls `adb_unlink_if_ours "$dest" "$repo"`, which removes a
destination only if it is **currently a symlink pointing back into `$repo`** —
never a real file or a symlink elsewhere. It receives no backup directory and
never writes one.

Do **not** re-implement `link()` / `unlink_if_ours()` inline — sourcing the one
shared copy is the point (design-principle #1; see
[design-principles.md](design-principles.md)). The `codex` and `gemini`
adapters are the reference: a source line plus two `adb_*` calls each.

## 2. Add `foo` to `scripts/build.sh`

Add one `render(...)` call so `foo`'s root doc is generated from
`base/practices/*.md` like the other three:

```bash
render "$root/agents/foo/FOO.md" "Global engineering practices"
```

Run `bash scripts/build.sh` and commit the generated file — CI re-runs this
script and fails the build if the checked-in output has drifted from what
`base/practices/*.md` would currently render, so this step isn't optional
even though the file is generated.

`scripts/build.sh` also renders `base/workflows/*.md` — the single source for
each workflow's procedure + metadata — into **every wired agent's** skills
(`agents/<agent>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) via `render_agent_skill`. Claude,
Codex, and Antigravity/Gemini all converge on the agent-skills `SKILL.md`
folder standard, so `render_agent_skill` is generic — an agent needs only a
`case` arm supplying three things: its placeholder **map** (each neutral
`{{TOKEN}}` → that agent's real token), its frontmatter **mode** (`verbatim`
keeps Claude passthrough keys; `synth` emits a minimal `name` + `description`),
and its output tree. If `foo` uses the same `SKILL.md` surface, add a `case`
arm and a `render_agent_skill foo "$wf"` call in the render loop; if it uses a
different surface, its renderer plugs in the same way and reads the same
`base/workflows/*.md` sources — either way the workflows are authored once, not
re-authored per agent. A `render()` for `foo`'s root doc is all that's required
for `foo` to be installable and role-assignable; native skills are the optional
deeper parity described below.

## 3. Register `foo` in `base/roles.md`

Two additions to `base/roles.md`:

- **Agent tokens** list: add `foo` alongside `claude` · `codex` · `gemini`.
- **Cross-agent invocation table**: add a row with `foo`'s non-interactive
  entrypoint and the root config it reads, e.g.:

  | Agent | Non-interactive invocation | Root config it reads |
  |---|---|---|
  | `foo` | `foo exec --cd <repo> -` (adjust to `foo`'s actual CLI) | `~/.foo/FOO.md` |

  If `foo`, like `codex`, is slow enough on a full-repo pass to need a longer
  Bash timeout than the 2-minute default, document that the same way the
  codex-timeout note in `base/roles.md` does — name the concrete minimum
  timeout, don't just say "give it more time."

Once `foo` is in both places, it's automatically usable in any project's
`agents.toml [roles]` table for `primary`, `gap_analysis`, `review`, `debug`,
`issue_author`, or `release` — the role-resolution logic in
`base/roles.md`/the skills doesn't hardcode the three existing tokens; it
just looks up whatever string is configured.

## 4. Install it

```bash
cd ~/Code/ai-dev-baseline
./install.sh --agent foo
```

This runs `write_global_manifest` (writes
`~/.config/ai-dev-baseline/agents.toml` if it doesn't already exist — no
change needed there, the manifest format doesn't enumerate agent tokens) and
`run_adapter foo`, which now finds `agents/foo/adapter.sh` and actually
installs it instead of printing the "deferred" message.

## 5. Confirm the role table works end to end

- Set `primary = "foo"` (or any other role) in a test repo's `agents.toml`.
- Run a workflow that reads that role (e.g. `/implement-issue`) and confirm
  it resolves `foo`'s cross-agent invocation correctly when `foo` isn't the
  agent currently driving.
- Run `agent-init` in a fresh repo and confirm `foo` appears as a valid value
  wherever the printed effective-role-map script expects a quoted token.

## What's deliberately out of scope here

This doc covers making `foo` **installable and assignable** — the floor every
existing agent already meets. Native workflow skills (a `render_agent_skill`
arm rendering `/implement-issue`, `/debug`, `/cleanup`, `/create-issue`,
`/new-release`, `/resolve-pr-threads` onto `foo`'s skill surface) and a
Stop-hook-equivalent gating mechanism (if `foo`'s harness supports one) are the
harder, optional part on top. Claude, Codex, and Antigravity all reach native
skills today; a Stop-hook enforcement equivalent for the non-Claude agents is
still tracked follow-up work (#14/#25). A project can assign `foo` to `review`
or `debug` the moment it is installable and role-assignable — via its
cross-agent invocation alone, before any native skills exist — exactly the way
`codex` and `gemini` served as `review`/`gap_analysis` agents before their
skills were wired.
