# Verify repo scope before starting

Before implementing an issue, fixing a bug from a ticket, or acting on any
reference, **confirm it belongs to _this_ repository.**

## Check

- `gh issue view <n>` in the current repo. If it 404s, or the body clearly
  describes a different codebase (wrong file paths, wrong stack, wrong product),
  it probably lives in another repo.
- When given several issue numbers, verify each — a batch can span repos.

## If there's a mismatch

**Stop and say which repo the work maps to.** Do not guess, and do not start
implementing against the wrong codebase. One misrouted issue can waste an entire
session of exploration before the mismatch surfaces.

## Why

A whole session was once lost because the requested issues lived in a different
repository than the one that was checked out. A three-second `gh issue view`
up front fails fast instead.
