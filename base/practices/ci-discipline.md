# CI discipline

**A failing CI job is a signal to diagnose, not a button to re-press.**

Never re-run a failed or "flaky" CI job as a first resort. Re-running burns CI
minutes, hides the root cause, and — if it happens to go green — ships a latent
bug.

## Protocol when CI fails

1. **Read the failure log.** Get the actual error, not the summary status.
2. **Classify: flaky or real.** A real failure reproduces; a flaky one is a
   timing/order/resource/network artifact. Say which, with evidence.
3. **If real → fix the root cause.** Then push the fix. Do not re-run against the
   old commit.
4. **If genuinely flaky →** file an issue to de-flake it (name the suspected
   cause: ordering, a fixed date aging out, a timeout, a shared fixture), *then*
   re-run. A flaky test you re-ran past is technical debt you now owe an issue.
5. **Never merge on a flaky re-run alone.** Green-by-retry is not green.

## Common "flaky" causes that are actually real

- Fixed seed dates that age past a now-relative filter (freeze the clock instead).
- Test-order dependence / shared mutable fixtures.
- Cross-platform assumptions (path separators, line endings, locale, timezone).
- A deployed environment lagging the default branch behind a release gate —
  see `debugging.md`.

## Why

Re-running flaky CI instead of fixing the cause is the classic lazy shortcut. The
cost is real (wasted minutes) and the risk is worse (a hidden bug shipped by a
lucky green). Diagnose first, always.
